How it works:
1.Timekeeping: The RTC module contains a crystal oscillator and a battery-backed counter that tracks time accurately, day after day. 
2.Alarm functionality: The RTC allows you to set a specific time and date for an alarm. The RTC can generate a signal when the alarm time is reached. 
3.Activation: A microcontroller, such as an Arduino, receives this signal and activates an output device to alert you. 
4.Display: An LCD screen is commonly used to display the current time and date, as well as the set alarm time. 
5.Input: Buttons or a keypad are used to set the time, date, and alarm. 
6.Power backup: The RTC module has a separate battery, often a coin cell, to keep it running when the main power is disconnected, preventing it from losing time.
